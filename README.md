# UX_Snippets
Devtools code snippets for troubleshooting

## refreshUXSnippets.js
In order to refresh the UX snippets, you must open a DevTools window for the current DevTools window and run the snippet from there.

1. Press Command+Option+i (Ctrl+Shift+i on Windows) to open DevTools.
2. Make sure that the developer tools are undocked into a new window. You may have to undock from the menu at the top right.

3. Press Command+Option+i again on this new window.
4. Run refreshUXSnippets.js from the new DevTools window.


That will open the DevTools on the DevTools.
You can redock the page's DevTools if you want.
If it's not already, select Elements â€” it's the first icon at the top of the inspector.
